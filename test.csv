"JUNE 03, 2022","Dear Diary, I am waiting for dinner while heading to my home by train. I bought a drink for my mom. Because  when I had it before, she asked me if it was good. She didn't say she want to try it at that time though, I bought it today for her. Today was my work day. Only five hours of shift. I made movie posters to show new available movies on netflix. Students here can use Netflix as language learning equipment. Nothing difficult. But I was surprised when I told to make one for Midsommar. I made sure to recreate the poster to not scared the students but also to not give them wrong impression. Because it looks like a fantasy movie if I took all scary elements. My stomach is about making embarrassing noise :\ And I’m sleepy."
"JUNE 07, 2022","Dear Diary, I am heading to home now. I’m on the train. Today was a good day actually. I went to my part time job in my flat shoes so I didn’t get tired that much. Talking about today’s highlight, it was  the talk with Anna. She graduated from our uni and started this job one year earlier than me. And It turned out our situation might be similar enough to say ours are similar. She told me like she wanted to work in airline company but she couldn’t have that job due to covid. And then lost her motivation to get a real job. Me..? I had to go through the depression while I should have being manage my job search. I thought I might want to be a translator (and yes I had tried that for a year as a part time job once) again last night and got motivated little bit to learn for it. My grammar isn’t perfect and I make lots of typos. But it can be improved… right…? Is it not too late? Study for trials…? I painted my nails with that pistachio green polish."
"JUNE 09, 2022","I’m thinking about one thing again and again recently. It was friends of mine I used to exchange texts with like everyday. For a year.  But my life suddenly became dark two years ago. So I couldn’t reply them ever since. And it has been two years.  I’m doing okay now. But is it no good to say hi to them…? Would people get confused or bothered if they got text in this kind of situation?  And how would I write them after two years? Can I just say hi and keep it short and make sure I don’t try to explain everything, then just wait how they react? If they seem to be not interested, I can let it go. Can it be a selfish act? Or not? I think they and I were enjoy texting each other. And I feel guilty for cut our relationships all the sudden. Actually it wasn’t first time and first time I made a two months absence, I explained to them. If they want to talk to me again, they might leave a message for me already……? And they didn’t. So I shouldn’t show them my existence anymore…?"
"JUNE 11, 2022","Dear Diary, I don’t know if this is a positive thing it not. Today and also yesterday, I googled for some job. Good! Then lost my confidence/motivation and mental energy. Baad! I think I should have a full time job while I am young and fresh. Yeah that’s how it work here. If this is like voluntarily will of mine, it is positive thing. I might reach out career adviser sooner or later. I don’t know"
"JUNE 15, 2022","Dear Diary, this is weird but my subconscious mind feels like, there are one “me” par a country in this world. I have no idea what makes it feel like that tho. And also I barely remember my mind has such idea while I live in my nation. I remember this idea especially when I visit other countries. I am like “oh okay, so people live their own lives in their own cultures, values and there are no me others than me” and add “that’s kinda weird” My travel is basically sightseeing so all I visit is not that deep. It almost same life around me back in my country. Supermarkets, cars, cafes and museums, hotel, shower, t-shirt, jeans, bread and rice… Almost same. I don’t understand their languages and they have different beliefs and education systems. I know, but still, almost same. Then why there are no “me, this country edition”. My subconscious mind asks me."
"JUNE 16, 2022","Dear Diary, I killed Human looked zombie in my dream. I harpooned his upper back to destroy his langs. I moved it like crazy in his body but it wasnt work. I felt sorry and scared but In the dream I had no choice to protect the house and people there by doing so. But actually, he was still alive after that. He kept attacking us and I woke up. WTF"
