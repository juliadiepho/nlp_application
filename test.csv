2022-06-02,"Dear Diary, it’s currently quoter before two but I’m still awake. My mom is working on document for changing my little sister’s disabilities pension. Her level has been changing heavier. And umm my mom needs to write detailed information on the document. That’s why she read my sisters school grade/life records after ten years from they were written. I read some of her teachers comments. Each of them were so cute. But my favorite was from her science class in her 4th grade. It was about her first veggie crop harvesting. Her plant was green pepper and the comment said she seemed so delighted of her first crop from her plant. so that she chose pink to express the happiness to draw it on her observation diary. And her teacher had to tell her to choose green or something. How beautiful this story is. I am so proud of her. But she isn’t like that anymore. The characteristic of down syndrome is appearing more and I can feel how hard is the mold of her way of thinking became."
2022-06-03,"Dear Diary, I am waiting for dinner while heading to my home by train. I bought a drink for my mom. Because  when I had it before, she asked me if it was good. She didn't say she want to try it at that time though, I bought it today for her. Today was my work day. Only five hours of shift. I made movie posters to show new available movies on netflix. Students here can use Netflix as language learning equipment. Nothing difficult. But I was surprised when I told to make one for Midsommar. I made sure to recreate the poster to not scared the students but also to not give them wrong impression. Because it looks like a fantasy movie if I took all scary elements. My stomach is about making embarrassing noise :\ And I’m sleepy."
2022-06-07,"Dear Diary, I am heading to home now. I’m on the train. Today was a good day actually. I went to my part time job in my flat shoes so I didn’t get tired that much. Talking about today’s highlight, it was  the talk with Anna. She graduated from our uni and started this job one year earlier than me. And It turned out our situation might be similar enough to say ours are similar. She told me like she wanted to work in airline company but she couldn’t have that job due to covid. And then lost her motivation to get a real job. Me..? I had to go through the depression while I should have being manage my job search. I thought I might want to be a translator (and yes I had tried that for a year as a part time job once) again last night and got motivated little bit to learn for it. My grammar isn’t perfect and I make lots of typos. But it can be improved… right…? Is it not too late? Study for trials…? I painted my nails with that pistachio green polish."
