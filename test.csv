"JUNE 03, 2022","Dear Diary, I am waiting for dinner while heading to my home by train. I bought a drink for my mom. Because  when I had it before, she asked me if it was good. She didn't say she want to try it at that time though, I bought it today for her. Today was my work day. Only five hours of shift. I made movie posters to show new available movies on netflix. Students here can use Netflix as language learning equipment. Nothing difficult. But I was surprised when I told to make one for Midsommar. I made sure to recreate the poster to not scared the students but also to not give them wrong impression. Because it looks like a fantasy movie if I took all scary elements. My stomach is about making embarrassing noise :\ And Iâ€™m sleepy."
