Dear Diary, it’s currently quoter befor two but I’m still awake. 
My mom is working on document for changing my little sister’s disabilities pension. Her level has been changing heavier. 
And umm my mom needs to write detailed information on the document. That’s why she read my sisters school grade/life records after ten years from they were written. I read some of her teachers comments. Each of them were so cute. But my favorite was from her science class in her 4th grade. It was about her first veggie crop harvesting. Her plant was green pepper and the comment said she seemed so delighted of her first crop from her plant. so that she chose pink to express the happiness to draw it on her observation diary. And her teacher had to tell her to choose green or something. How beautiful this story is. I am so proud of her. 
But she isn’t like that anymore. The characteristic of down syndrome is appearing more and I can feel how hard is the mold of her way of thinking became. 
It’s hard to watch my closest person changing. I know it’s for everyone’s problem. Most of us must experience our parents getting weaker. But still I feel like it’s only for our family at this moment. Oh the reason is, I just found out by the way, that im in my 20s and my friends rarely think about it yet. So that’s why it’s only for me for now. 
No need to be afraid that much. I Stil got time to gradually accept this as she gradually changes. I want to be with / focus on her happy moment together even after realized it doesn’t last forever. Nothing lasts forever.and it’s scary. Especially it was about something we love and cherish. 
One funny? example is T lex. They probably were the strongest being on the earth!! But how now? They were gone and we go to see the bone! 
Cherry blossom last less than a month or less after the full bloom.  
Remember the Beatles’ song. “It is not dying” tomorrow never knows
Dream is not living it says. I take this line as “we dont need to worry too much about something not happened yet” 
play the game “existence” to the end 
Yes I would love to. But I can’t decide which token I would be yet. I’m still thinking. 
I am not really sure if I can fit in this society. My parents say it’s not scary as we hear but you know…
There are bunch of unkind people in the society. They are always seeking for their victims. I understand that I don’t need to care about their shit but I need to deal with my bad tendency of capture myself in their cage. 
I need to watch Adams family movie again.

Dear Diary, I am waiting for dinner while heading to my home by train. 
I bought a drink for my mom. Because  when I had it before, she asked me if it was good. She didn't say she want to try it at that time though, I bought it today for her. 
Today was my work day. Only five hours of shift. I made movie posters to show new available movies on netflix. Students here can use Netflix as language learning equipment. Nothing difficult. But I was surprised when I told to make one for Midsommar. I made sure to recreate the poster to not scared the students but also to not give them wrong impression. Because it looks like a fantasy movie if I took all scary elements. 
My stomach is about making embarrassing noise :\
And I’m sleepy.

Dear Diary, I am heading to home now. I’m on the train. 
Today was a good day actually. I went to my part time job in my flat shoes so I didn’t get tired that much. 
Talking about today’s highlight, it was  the talk with Anna. She graduated from our uni and started this job one year earlier than me. And It turned out our situation might be similar enough to say ours are similar. She told me like she wanted to work in airline company but she couldn’t have that job due to covid. And then lost her motivation to get a real job. Me..? I had to go through the depression while I should have being manage my job search. 
I thought I might want to be a translator (and yes I had tried that for a year as a part time job once) again last night and got motivated little bit to learn for it. My grammar isn’t perfect and I make lots of typos. But it can be improved… right…? Is it not too late? Study for trials…? 
Btw I painted my nails with that pistachio green polish. I thought it’s cute but it can look like zombie :P

I’m thinking about one thing again and again recently. 
It was friends of mine I used to exchange texts with like everyday. For a year.  
But my life suddenly became dark two years ago. So I couldn’t reply them ever since. And it has been two years.  I’m doing okay now. 
But is it no good to say hi to them…? 
Would people get confused or bothered if they got text in this kind of situation?  
And how would I write them after two years? Can I just say hi and keep it short and make sure I don’t try to explain everything, then just wait how they react? If they seem to be not interested, I can let it go. Can it be a selfish act? Or not? 
I think they and I were enjoy texting each other. And I feel guilty for cut our relationships all the sudden. 
Actually it wasn’t first time and first time I made a two months absence, I explained to them. 
If they want to talk to me again, they might leave a message for me already……? And they didn’t. So I shouldn’t show them my existence anymore…? 
Do you have this kind of experience? 
What is a good way you think? 

Dear Diary, 
In conclusion, I can say it was a good decision to text someone after a long time. I know it’s not always bring a wanted result. But how could you know? My point was… I didn’t want to make them feel somewhat uncomfortable or awkward or something. I feel uncomfortable depending on who text me after a long  time. And reply sometimes. Because it makes me feel I should do it. And the inside of my chest feels weird noisy uncomfortableness. And I don’t like it at all. I have ignored some. Feeling annoyed and also guilt about it. I don’t want to make my people feel the same because I hate it so much. 
By the way, this is the article…

I hope those friends of mine don’t use this web site lol. Probably not I assume. 
I texted to two friends of mine today and one of them kindly gave me replies🥺🥺🥺☀️

Dear Diary, 
I don’t know if this is a positive thing it not. Today and also yesterday, I googled for some job. Good! 
Then lost my confidence/motivation and mental energy. Baad! 
I think I should have a full time job while I am young and fresh. Yeah that’s how it work here. 
If this is like voluntarily will of mine, it is positive thing. I might reach out career adviser sooner or later 
I don’t know

Dear Diary, today I went to walk to a doller shop and bought my little sister jigsaw puzzles. I wasn’t sure if she could enjoy them. But she liked it and finished both at once! I didn’t expected this! She tends to get irritated and give up when she can’t solve problems. So I found a good material to train her brain while she can have fun! 
My parents told me nothing other than she was born with D.S. and they thinks it’s good for me to do not share the details but it actually not. It made me believe they don’t want to speak about it at least with me. But my mom was like she thought I understood everything. What’s even ‘every thing?’ I believed like we are a bit different from others but we will live happily as we do now. But the truth is the symptom get heavier as she get old. But common families have similar problem too (parents getting to old or a such and forget who they were) so we don’t have to think it’s only for us, that’s what my school counselor told me. 
Okay then I just keep trying to stimulate her brain as possible I can during this covid era.

Dear Diary, this is weird but my subconscious mind feels like, there are one “me” par a country in this world. I have no idea what makes it feel like that tho. 
And also I barely remember my mind has such idea while I live in my nation. I remember this idea especially when I visit other countries. I am like “oh okay, so people live their own lives in their own cultures, values and there are no me others than me” and add “that’s kinda weird” 
My travel is basically sightseeing so all I visit is not that deep. It almost same life around me back in my country. Supermarkets, cars, cafes and museums, hotel, shower, t-shirt, jeans, bread and rice… Almost same. I don’t understand their languages and they have different beliefs and education systems. I know, but still, almost same. 
Then why there are no “me, this country edition” 
My subconscious mind asks me.
